# ECHO SERVER
# -----------
 
This is a simple ECHO server based on several examples found online.

There is a EchoPacket which defines the packet format exchanged between
server and client.

The server is EchoServer invoked using:

# java EchoServer <port>

which listens on a port <port> provided as argument.

** EchoServer can also be started by using the server.sh script.
** ./server.sh

The client is EchoClient which is invokes using:

# java EchoClient <server> <port>

The client connects to <server> at port <port>. The client also opens a console for you to type messages. 

** EchoClient can also be started by using the client.sh script.
** ./client.sh

A typical session looks like.

CONSOLE>hello
echo:hello
CONSOLE>hi
echo:hi
CONSOLE>bye
